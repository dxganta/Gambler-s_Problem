# Gambler-s_Problem
I solve the Gambler's Problem using Value Iteration from the book Reinforcement Learning (2nd Edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andre G. Barto


Problem:
A gambler has the opportunity to make bets on
the outcomes of a sequence of coin flips. If the coin comes up heads, he wins as many
dollars as he has staked on that flip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game ends
when the gambler wins by reaching his goal of $100, or loses by running out of money.
On each flip, the gambler must decide what portion of his capital to stake, in integer
numbers of dollars.
